CAT FIGHT is a Pok√©mon-style battle game.  Each player will pick 2 cats and battle them to the death!

## My Process

  - Create a wire frame for how I want the game to look.  Think about how many different screens I want to have and what content will be on each respective screen
  - Code the bulk of the HTML.  Create a different <section> for each screen of the game and give each <section> a symantic ID
  - Start coding some of the CSS.  Mostly just flexing different elements to arrange them on the page the way I want, trying to match my wire frame as much as possible
  - Start coding the JavaScript.  Start with the simplest functions first, like event listeners on buttons and the basic logic of the game
  - Slowly add game functionality, incorporating one function at a time and making sure it works as intended
  - DRY out code throughout the process, where ever I notice chunks of code being repeated
  - Once the game is working mostly as intended, go back and add CSS styling and animations to make the game more visually appealing
  - Play though the game several times, making changes where necessary

### Unsolved Problems
The game pretty much functions as I intended.  Originally, instead of a heal, I wanted each Cat to have a buff or debuff ability.  I believe it would make the game more dynamic and interesting.  Certains buffs/debuffs would work well with other Cat's specials, allowing a player to incoporate more strategy/tactics by comboing abilities.

This is an achievable goal, given more time.

I would also like to:
 - Add several more cats to choose from
 - Allow players to pick more than just 2 cats
 - Make each cat much more varied in terms of HP, Base Attack and Special, while maintaining a decent balance
 - Add more pictures of each cat, like an attack/death pose
 - Style the game to have more interesting animations

## Wins & Challenges

 - Getting the Pick Screen to display each Cat's info when you hover over their picture
 - Coding the game to draft in a snake draft, as oppossed to just alternating
 - Creating the Health Bars and having them be updated with each attack
 - Making sure the game knows when a Cat is dead and not allowing a Player to switch if it's other cat is dead
 - Getting the win condition to execute when a Player's Cats are dead

## Tech Used
Cat Fight utilizes only a couple of things to work:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Sublime Text Editor
* Git & GitHub

### Installation

Cat Fight only requires a web browser to be played.  Enjoy!
